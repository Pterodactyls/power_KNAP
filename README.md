## Usage

Duplicate the `default.env` to setup environmental variables and make sure it is added to gitignore!
> Notes on environmental variables:
- ```DATABASE_URL```: ```postgress://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@localhost:${PORT}/${DATABASE_NAME}```
- ```LOCAL``` variable can be 0 (false for production development) or 1 (true for local development)
- Apply for a [Google oAuth key](https://console.developers.google.com) to receive a ```GOOGLECLIENTID``` and ```GOOGLECLIENTSECRET``` key
  - Upon arriving at the linked site, enable APIs and services and search for Google+ API
  - Create credentials and pass in ```http://localhost:${PORT}``` to Authorized JavaScript origins and ```http://localhost:${PORT}/auth/google/redirect``` to Authorized redirect URIs
- Create a random cookie key (really, what ever string you want) for ```COOKIEKEY```; this is for encryption
